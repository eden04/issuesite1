        <div class="solutionright"> <h5>On-Campus Recycling:</h5>Not every college student lives on campus and has access to a dorm recycling bin. Soemtimes, when styding at the university's coffeshop or dining hall, students need to recycle. Adding recycling bins to building lobbies, food/drink areas, and classrooms is one approach to solving the lack of recycling accessibility. Another solution is providing outdoor and indoor recycling bins that are connected to trash but with separate containers. That way, students will have access around campus to recycle. To keep students posted on what can and cannot be recycled in Illinois, offer the following PDF from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency: <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/epa/topics/waste-management/Documents/RecyclingGuidelinesHR_Illinois.pdf" target="_blank">Recycling Guidelines</a></div><br><br><br><br>

Students utilized to-go boxes and drinks containers to do so. With the product's popularity booming around America, Styrofoam became the go-to solution. However, Green Paper Products offer biodegradable boxes, paper cups, cultery, and designated hot/cold containers that are more recycable and sustainable than Styrofoam. Switching to Green Paper Products displays thoughtfulness to the incoming students who hope to keep their college sustainable and clean. Sustainable options and pricings can be found at <a href="https://greenpaperproducts.com/">Green Paper Products</a></div>

        <div class="solutionright"> <h5>Educating Students:</h5>
        Many students move states away for college, and they don't have the time to discover what they can/can't recycle. By providing a one-time lecture informing new students of local recycling, affects of littering, and proper energy usage, they can take on college witha  conscious mind. From this, they may, maintain Illinois college campuses and cut down on energy expenses. If students understood that a year of food waste could supply more than 50 million homes in America, they'll be more conscious of the food they take from cafeterias (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/preventing-wasted-food-home">"Preventing Wasted Food At Home" - EPA</a>).
